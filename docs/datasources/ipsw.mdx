# IPSW

Type: `ipsw`

The IPSW data source will fetch and filter information about
[Apple device firmware](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IPSW)
releases from [AppleDB](https://appledb.dev/), providing release
data and IPSW URLs for builders such as [Tart](https://github.com/cirruslabs/packer-plugin-tart).

```hcl
data "ipsw" "bigsur" {
  os = "macOS"
  version = "^13"

}
```

Then use result via e.g. `${data.ipsw.bigsur.version}` and `${data.ipsw.bigsur.url}`.
